## Rush00 Piscine PHP at 42

During this project, we had to build an e-commerce website in 2 days which includes:

- An install.php which build the database
- A landing page
- An admin panel which we can edit all users, products and order
- A list of products (we chose to build a DVD store)
- A cart which we must be logged in to valid it (but we can fill it without being logged)
- Edit account section  

## Rules

- We aren't allowed to use OOP (Object-Oriented PHP)
- We must use mysqli or a serialize file
- No use any CSS templates or JS library
- Realize the backend in PHP
- No SQL exploit and no exploit at all  

Final rate: 109 / 100
